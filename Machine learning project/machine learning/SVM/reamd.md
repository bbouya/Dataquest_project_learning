Thiss is a tutorial for SVM algorithm
SVM or Support Vector Machine is a linear Model for classification and regression problems. It can solve linear and non-linear problems and work well for many practical problems. The idea of SVM is simple. The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane which seperates the data into classes.
We have used Iris dataset for explanation: 
1. Import Iris dataset.
2. Preprocess Data(ignored here)
3. Split data into train and test data
4. fit the training data in SVM model
5. Predict the test data
6. Evalute F2 score and print confusion Matrix
