# Presentation of project Analyzing the thanks giving 
In this project we will analyze data on thanksgiving dinner in The US, we will be working with the pandas library (not like the fist project we worked manualy with creating a function to do the job). We will convert the file (thansgiving.csv) into dataframe using pandas, in addition we will use several basic functions in pandas to explore the data.
