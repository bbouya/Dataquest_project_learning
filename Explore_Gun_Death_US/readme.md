# Projet Presentation Gun Death in Us
In this project we will look at the total number of gun deaths by race in the US in the file 'guns.csv', we will also use the us census ('census.csv') to convert the total number of gun deaths to a percentage by race(that not my idea plz be aware of that).
We will accomplish this by using basic functions in python to convert the files into a readable format and explore the data, in addition, we will also work with list comprehension techniques and the datetime library.
